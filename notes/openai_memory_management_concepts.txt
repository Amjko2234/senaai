[] 1. Database Setup - PostgreSQL + Connection Pooling
Search for: "PostgreSQL setup Ubuntu WSL2", "database connection pooling", "PostgreSQL vs SQLite performance", "database indexing strategies"
PostgreSQL over SQLite because: JSONB support (for storing message metadata), better concurrent access, more advanced querying, and industry-standard skills. Learn connection pooling early - it's crucial for production applications.

2. Information Retrieval - Hybrid Approach
Search for: "semantic search vs keyword search", "embedding-based retrieval", "vector similarity search", "conversation context windowing strategies", "relevance scoring algorithms"
Don't just grab recent messages. Implement semantic relevance retrieval - embed messages and find contextually similar ones. This is more complex but handles topic shifts intelligently. Learn both recency-based and relevance-based retrieval.

3. RAG - Yes, But Advanced RAG
Search for: "Retrieval Augmented Generation", "dense retrieval vs sparse retrieval", "embedding models for conversation", "reranking in RAG systems", "conversation-aware RAG"
Standard RAG is document-focused. You need conversation-aware RAG that understands dialogue flow, speaker identity, and temporal context. This is cutting-edge territory - perfect for learning.

4. Response Decision Logic - Multi-Agent Reasoning
Search for: "multi-agent AI systems", "conversation state machines", "intent classification", "response appropriateness scoring", "conversational AI decision trees", "prompt engineering for decision making"
Implement a multi-step decision process: Intent classification → Context analysis → Appropriateness scoring → Response generation. Each step can be a separate AI call or a multi-agent system.

5. Additional Concepts You Should Learn:
Message Understanding:

"Named Entity Recognition (NER)"
"Coreference resolution"
"Sentiment analysis in conversations"

System Architecture:

"Event-driven architecture for chat bots"
"Async programming patterns"
"Rate limiting strategies"
"Webhook vs polling for Discord bots"

Advanced Conversation Modeling:

"Conversation graphs and threading"
"Speaker diarization"
"Topic modeling for conversations"
"Conversation summarization techniques"

Monitoring/Analytics:

"Conversation quality metrics"
"Token usage optimization"
"A/B testing for conversational AI"

This path is significantly more complex than simple recent-message retrieval, but you'll build something genuinely sophisticated and learn concepts used in production AI systems. The rabbit holes here will teach you more than any tutorial series.RetryClaude can make mistakes. Please double-check responses.
